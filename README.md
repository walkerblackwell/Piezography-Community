# Piezography Community Edition

This is the "open" free Piezography Community Edition software. It consists of an archive of curves for Piezography ink sets and printer combos, soft-proof and print ICC profiles, and helpful tools. We are open-sourcing this 'software' in the hope that others will contribute their curves and print ICCs for various media. We are all stronger together. 

What it also included is the initial build folders (Windows and Mac) for the project. Building and distributing the package falls to InkjetMall.
